dotfiles for hyprland

The dotfiles might contain files from the HyDe config from [prasanthrangan/hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) because i had HyDe installed before
### Always make a backup before it breaks your system

# Things you'd need

1. [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
2. [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
3. [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
4. [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)

# Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Paste all the files into your `/home/.config` folder except assets folder and github files

### ⚠ Dont know whether if you'll get the required outcome as it has some [HyDe](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) files and as i haven't tested this on a fresh Hyprland install. OR you could manually remove each and every HyDe files which again can be found in the [HyDe](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) repository. ⚠
